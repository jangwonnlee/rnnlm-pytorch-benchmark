# rnnlm-pytorch-benchmark

This repository contains the rnnlm learning code implemented in pytorch.
In particular, the rnnlm learning code is based on the PTB data set and can be used for benchmark testing purposes. (See Mikolov RNNLM toolkit.)
The learning results were evaluated on a perplexity basis as follows, with 50 and 180 results respectively for training and validation data sets.

To run: 'python3 rnnlm.py'
